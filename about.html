<p class="abouttext"> Antithetical to typical 21st-century western approaches, <span class="emph">SPIFF</span> proposes an alternate method for furnishing spaces in which we dwell. SPIFF offers four structures, 1. for sitting, 2. for resting, 3. for storing and 4. for suspending; each of which are built out of <span class="emph">affordable and easily acquirable</span> materials. Designed for both <span class="emph">practicality and neutrality</span>, SPIFF’s four structures are advantageous in their form, yet can be decorated to satisfy each builder’s individual aesthetic. Each structure is <span class="emph">modifiable</span>, providing countless iterations along with optimal customization opportunities. SPIFF.build is an online platform that houses <span class="emph">comprehendible instructions</span> for constructing each structure. With the intention of accessibility, SPIFF.build utilizes Google Drive to ensure a <span class="emph">straightforward</span> sharing and uploading system. SPIFF hopes to <span class="emph"> foster a new avenue </span> in which spaces can become cheaply, yet efficiently furnished while still accommodating personal stylistic needs. </p>
